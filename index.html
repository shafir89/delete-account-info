    <h1>Account Deletion Information</h1>

    <p>
      Users can delete their accounts directly inside our mobile application.
      To delete your account, open the app and go to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Profile / Settings</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Delete Account</strong></li>
      <li>Confirm the deletion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once confirmed, the app sends a secure request to our backend API to permanently remove your account and all associated data.
    </p>

    <h2>If you can't access the app</h2>
    <p>
      You may request account deletion by contacting:  
      <strong>support@domainmu.com</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Your account will be deleted within 7 days according to our data policy.
